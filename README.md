## Description:
This Custom Component is to update the ISY994 component with various bug fixes, better Z-Wave integration, device state attribute support, ISY Variables support, and add Climate support for Insteon and Z-Wave Thermostats that are exposed by the ISY994 Controller hub component.  This will eventually be integrated into Home Assistant after PyISY updates are completed.

As of version 1.4.0, there are now services exposed for more control over your ISY devices! The following services are available:
 - `isy994.send_raw_node_command`: Send a "raw" ISY REST Device Command to a Node using its Home Assistant Entity ID.
 - `isy994.send_node_command`: Send a command to an ISY Device using its Home Assistant entity ID. Valid commands are: beep, brighten, dim, disable, enable, fade_down, fade_stop, fade_up, fast_off, fast_on, and query.
 - `isy994.set_on_level`: Send a ISY set_on_level command to a Node.
 - `isy994.set_ramp_rate`: Send a ISY set_ramp_rate command to a Node.
 - `isy994.system_query`: Request the ISY Query the connected devices.
 - `isy994.set_variable`: Set an ISY variable's current or initial value. Variables can be set by either type/address or by name.
 - `isy994.send_program_command`: Send a command to control an ISY program or folder. Valid commands are run, run_then, run_else, stop, enable, disable, enable_run_at_startup, and disable_run_at_startup.
 - `isy994.run_network_resource`: Run a network resource on the ISY.

### Now Configurable from the Integrations Page!

Notes: 

1. Multiple ISYs are supported if added from the Integrations page, just add one entry for each ISY. Make sure you do not have more than one in the `configuration.yaml` page, this will not work.

Thank you to [@bdraco](https://github.com/bdraco) for the help.
