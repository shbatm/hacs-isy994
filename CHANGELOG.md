## CHANGELOG - HACS Version of ISY994 Component

### [1.4.1] - Added Reload and Cleanup Services, Bye-bye Beta!

- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Good-bye beta! Now running on `pyisy==2.0.0`!
    + This is a major milestone towards enabling these changes to be migrated into the Home Assistant Core code, and have been over a year in the making!
- Added `isy994.reload` and `isy994.cleanup` services to reload the integration without restarting (to add new devices) and to cleanup old devices that have been removed or disabled on the ISY.

### [1.4.0] - Services, Variables Reavamped, Inheritance Fixes

#### BREAKING CHANGES!! - Variable Support Has Changed in this Version!

- To ensure future support and ability to merge the changes in this custom component into the Home Assistant core, some changes needed to be made to how variables were handled:
    + Variables are no longer configured in `configuration.yaml`.
    + A new `Variable Sensor String` config option has been added in the Integrations > Options page (or by using `variable_sensor_string: "HA."` in your `configuration.yaml`).
        * This behaves similarly to Sensor String and Ignore String for nodes: you need to rename the variables ***in your ISY*** to have the `Variable Sensor String` somewhere in the name.
        * If your Variable Sensor String is `"HA."` then every variable with `HA.` in the name will be imported as a sensor.
        * Additional configuration (changing device class, friendly name, unit of measurement, etc.) can be done using customizations in Home Assistant.
    + Variables as a `switch` or `binary_sensor` are no longer supported. This was a duplicate functionality that is already available [using Programs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/isy994/#creating-custom-devices)

#### New:

- Add services to ISY994 Integration to access additional commands available in PyISY, such as fast on/off and fade up/down/stop as well as enable/disable nodes. The following services are now available:
     + `isy994.send_raw_node_command`: Send a "raw" ISY REST Device Command to a Node using its Home Assistant Entity ID.
     + `isy994.send_node_command`: Send a command to an ISY Device using its Home Assistant entity ID. Valid commands are: beep, brighten, dim, disable, enable, fade_down, fade_stop, fade_up, fast_off, fast_on, and query.
     + `isy994.set_on_level`: Send a ISY set_on_level command to a Node.
     + `isy994.set_ramp_rate`: Send a ISY set_ramp_rate command to a Node.
     + `isy994.system_query`: Request the ISY Query the connected devices.
     + `isy994.set_variable`: Set an ISY variable's current or initial value. Variables can be set by either type/address or by name.
     + `isy994.send_program_command`: Send a command to control an ISY program or folder. Valid commands are run, run_then, run_else, stop, enable, disable, enable_run_at_startup, and disable_run_at_startup.
     + `isy994.run_network_resource`: Run a network resource on the ISY.

#### Fixed:

- Fix #51 - Temperatures are not converted if ISY thermostat and HASS are different units
- Fix #54 - Z-Wave Sensor showing UOM as integer next to actual state.

- Update function names to match new changes in PyISY-beta
- PyISY-beta has been updated to track changes merged into the PyISY V2 branch.

### [1.0.15] - Bump PyISY-beta to 2.0.0.dev90 to fix #11

- PyISY-beta==2.0.0.dev89 fixes the unhandled errors thrown by not having any Variables defined.

### [1.0.13] - Rollup Source Changes, PyISY_Beta Function Name Changes

- Include changes from home-assistant/home-assistant#30500 (52164773) for Home Assistant spelling consistency

### [1.0.11] - Jan 2020 Update

- Moved recording of extra attributes in the event stream from the Home Assistant integration into the PyISY module.
- Fixed erroneous errors when updating statuses for Thermostats.
- Added "group all on" attribute to scenes/groups to show if all of the devices in the group are on, or just some of them.
- Fixed "hint" assuming a device would turn on to full brightness - now instead of jumping to full brightness and back to the correct level if a local On Level is set, it will jump to the On Level.
- Fixed Brightness=255 from assuming device would turn on to full brightness, did not account for local On Levels. Now will actually send Brightness=255 if it is passed.

### [pre-1.0.10] Differences from Home Assistant Core ISY994 Integration

- Move constants to a dedicated `const.py` file.
- Add support for Climate devices per `climate-1.0` changes.
- Expand ISY Z-Wave support by properly classifying devices using the `devtype.cat` attribute.
- Fixes issues with `device_state_attributes` throwing Type errors and getting overwritten on updates from the ISY--now maintains a updatable dict and adds attributes when provided from the ISY EventStream (ISY doesn't always provide all attributes on the initial query).
- Fixes ISY Heartbeats per #21996
- Update ISYBinarySensorHeartbeat to report state on startup if available.
- Revised comments to better clarify the behaviors of the heartbeat node in Home Assistant since it does not report the actual state of the ISY's sub-node (which could be on or off).
- Add logic for Motion Sensor subnodes, update framework for Z-Wave IDs.
- Allow ISY Variables to be used as sensors, binary_sensors, and switches.
- The `isy994_control` event has been updated to also expose `value`.  This is expected to be a non-breaking change in PyISY; (PyISY's `event` is now a `dict` instead of a `string`, but will represent itself the same as the command string it used to pass).  This change is vital to the `climate` integration, as some values are only made available from the event stream, not the node definition.
